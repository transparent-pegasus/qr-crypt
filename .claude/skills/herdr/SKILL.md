# herdr — agent skill

before using this skill, check that `HERDR_ENV=1`. if it is not set to `1`, say you are not running inside a herdr-managed pane and stop. do not inspect or control the focused herdr pane from outside herdr.

you are running inside herdr, a terminal-native agent multiplexer. herdr gives you workspaces, tabs, and panes — each pane is a real terminal with its own shell, agent, server, or log stream — and you can control all of it from the cli.

this means you can:

- create tabs for separate subcontexts inside one workspace
- split panes and run commands in them
- start servers, watch logs, and run tests in sibling panes

to delegate operational work to idle agents in sibling panes, use the [`using-herdr-sibling-panes`](../using-herdr-sibling-panes/SKILL.md) skill.

the `herdr` binary is available in your PATH. its workspace, tab, pane, and wait commands talk to the running herdr instance over a local unix socket.

if you need the raw protocol or full api reference, read the [socket api docs](https://herdr.dev/docs/socket-api/).

## concepts

**workspaces** are project contexts. each workspace has one or more tabs. unless manually renamed, a workspace's label follows the first tab's root pane — usually the repo name, otherwise the root pane's current folder name.

**tabs** are subcontexts inside a workspace. each tab has one or more panes.

**panes** are terminal splits inside a tab. each pane runs its own process — a shell, an agent, a server, anything.

**ids** — workspace ids look like `1`, `2`. tab ids look like `1:1`, `1:2`, `2:1`. pane ids look like `1-1`, `1-2`, `2-1`. these are compact public ids for the current live session.

important: ids can compact when tabs, panes, or workspaces are closed. do not treat them as durable ids. re-read ids from `workspace list`, `tab list`, `pane list`, or create/split responses when you need a current id. do not guess that an older `1-3` is still the same pane later.

## discover yourself

see what panes exist and which one is focused:

```bash
herdr pane list
```

the focused pane is yours. other panes are your neighbors.

list workspaces:

```bash
herdr workspace list
```

## tab management

list tabs in the current workspace:

```bash
herdr tab list --workspace 1
```

create a new tab:

```bash
herdr tab create --workspace 1
```

without `--label`, the new tab keeps the default numbered tab name.

create and name it in one step:

```bash
herdr tab create --workspace 1 --label "logs"
```

rename it:

```bash
herdr tab rename 1:2 "logs"
```

focus it:

```bash
herdr tab focus 1:2
```

close it:

```bash
herdr tab close 1:2
```

## split a pane and run a command

split your pane to the right and keep focus on your current pane:

```bash
herdr pane split 1-2 --direction right --no-focus
```

that prints json with the new pane nested at `result.pane.pane_id`. parse that value, then run a command in that pane:

```bash
NEW_PANE=$(herdr pane split 1-2 --direction right --no-focus | python3 -c 'import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["result"]["pane"]["pane_id"])')
herdr pane run "$NEW_PANE" "npm run dev"
```

split downward instead:

```bash
herdr pane split 1-2 --direction down --no-focus
```

## workspace management

create a new workspace:

```bash
herdr workspace create --cwd /path/to/project
```

without `--label`, the new workspace keeps the default cwd-based name.

create and name one in one step:

```bash
herdr workspace create --cwd /path/to/project --label "api server"
```

create one without focusing it:

```bash
herdr workspace create --no-focus
```

focus a workspace:

```bash
herdr workspace focus 2
```

rename:

```bash
herdr workspace rename 1 "api server"
```

close:

```bash
herdr workspace close 2
```

## close a pane

```bash
herdr pane close 1-3
```

## recipes

### run a server and wait until it is ready

```bash
NEW_PANE=$(herdr pane split 1-2 --direction right --no-focus | python3 -c 'import sys,json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)["result"]["pane"]["pane_id"])')
herdr pane run "$NEW_PANE" "npm run dev"
herdr wait output "$NEW_PANE" --match "ready" --timeout 30000
herdr pane read "$NEW_PANE" --source recent --lines 20
```

### run tests in a separate pane and inspect the result

```bash
herdr pane split 1-2 --direction down --no-focus
herdr pane run 1-3 "cargo test"
herdr wait output 1-3 --match "test result" --timeout 60000
herdr pane read 1-3 --source recent --lines 30
```

## notes

- `workspace list`, `workspace create`, `tab list`, `tab create`, `tab get`, `tab focus`, `tab rename`, `tab close`, `pane list`, `pane get`, and `pane split` print json on success.
- parse ids from `workspace create`, `tab create`, and `pane split` responses when you need new ids. `workspace create` returns `result.workspace`, `result.tab`, and `result.root_pane`. `tab create` returns `result.tab` and `result.root_pane`. for `pane split`, the new pane id is at `result.pane.pane_id`.
- `--no-focus` on split, tab create, and workspace create keeps your current terminal context focused.
- without `--label`, workspace create keeps cwd-based naming and tab create keeps numbered naming.
- `--label` on tab create and workspace create applies the custom name immediately.
- if you are running inside herdr, the `HERDR_ENV` environment variable is set to `1`.
